This file contains instructions on how to set and use the "SubmissionHelper.sh" script



--Note:
--------

- lines starting by % are command lines

- command lines with <TEXT> are to be adapted to your specific "TEXT" values



--Prerequisite:
-------------

- make sure that at least F4DE's "make mincheck" and "make KWSEvalcheck" complete succesfully ('make' commands are run from the base F4DE's directory)

- you must have a functional scp command with an associated account (with a passphrase) on the scoring transfer system. We recommend having an 'ssh-agent' in place to faciliate data transfer

- require "JobRunner.pl" 

- (for scoring) require the 'sctk' tool installed (at least version 2.4.4).
See: http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/tools.cfm

- an understanding of the EXPID composition from the BABEL Evaluation Plan

- the matching KWSEval system input files (ECF and Keyword List files)
to the EXPID you are submitting



--Configuration Steps:
-------------------

In order to be able to use the tool (SubmissionHelper.sh), its
configuration file (SubmissionHelper.cfg) must be created.

For BABEL 2012, the simplest way to do so is to make a symbolic link
from SubmissionHelper_BABEL12.cfg to SubmissionHelper.cfg:

% ln -s SubmissionHelper_BABEL12.cfg SubmissionHelper.cfg

The default configuration file is designed to make everything work
from the current directory, 'JobRunner.pl', 
and the 'bin' directory for the SCTK installation.
For this to happen, please make symbolic link to your installation
location of the tools to the current directory:

% ln -s <JOBRUNNER_DIRECTORY>/JobRunner.pl

% ln -s <SCTK_INSTALL_BIN_DIRECTORY> sctkbin

Edit the 'scp_user' line to reflect your scoring transfer system account information.

Familiarize yourself with the list of options of the tool by running it without any option:

% ./SubmissionHelper.sh

Confirm that the "SubmissionHelper.sh" tool is functional by
calling it from the current directory with a invalid file (such as
this README), which should fail, but will confirm that the expected
entries from the configuration file (SubmissionHelper.cfg) are
presumed valid:

% ./SubmissionHelper.sh README


-- Manual configuration:
---------------------

If you decide to not use the default configuration, please copy
SubmissionHelper_BABEL12.cfg to SubmissionHelper.cfg and adapt 
fields in the copied file.


-- Submiting an EXPID:
-------------------

Simply run the "SubmissionHelper.sh" tool (from the current location)
with a valid EXPID submission, and follow the step by step description
of the processing:

% ./SubmissionHelper.sh <EXPID>.kwslist.xml

Note: It is possible to interrupt the process and restart it at a
later time by running the same command line with the exact same
"<EXPID>.kwslist.xml" file
