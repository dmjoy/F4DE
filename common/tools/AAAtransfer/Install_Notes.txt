This file contains instructions on how to install 'aaagent' so that it
can be used with the "AAAtransfer" tool.



--Note:
---------

- those steps have been confirmed to work on Ubuntu Linux (11.10) as
well as Mac OS X (Snow Leopard & Lion)

- lines starting by % are command lines

- command lines with <TEXT> are to be adapted to your specific "TEXT" values



--Prerequisite:
-------------

- you must have a valid "AAlicense.cfg"

- make sure F4DE's "make check" complete succesfully

- the Agent tool requires Python (confirmed to work using 2.7.3) with
the following modules installed: zope2 pycrypto twisted pyasn1 pyxml pycurl
(see Appendix for installation help)



--Installation Steps:
-----------------

1) Uncompress the "AAA-Linux.tar.bz2" archive (a "AAA" directory will
be created) into the directory where you want the tool tree structure
to be available. The tool will be run from within this AAA directory,
as the tool's databases will be created within the uncompressed
directory structure. Once completed, go into the "AAA" directory

% cd <AAA_DESTINATION_DIR>
% tar xvfj <AAARCHIVE_DOWNLOAD_DIR>/AAA-Linux.tar.bz2
% cd AAA


2) Put the license file into the "aclagent/config" directory and make
a symbolic link of 'config' to the 'AAA' base directory 

% cp <AALICENSE_DOWNLOAD_DIR>/AAlicense.cfg aclagent/config
% ln -s aclagent/config config

3) Create the "aaagent" executable (copy paste the following command line):

% echo 'cd '`pwd`';'`which python2.7`' aclagent/aaagent.py $*' > aaagent
% chmod +x aaagent

4) Confirm the executable is not complaining of missing modules and
prompts you with its usage content (the first line should start with
"Usage:" )

% ./aaagent

*** Proxy use ***

If you need to use a proxy, after finishing the installation of 'aaagent',
please edit the <AAA_DESTINATION_DIR>/AAA/config/AAconfiguration.txt
and add/adapt the following lines to the "[configuration]" section of the file:

ProxyServer = <proxy host name>:<port number>
ProxyUserPassword = <user_name>:<password>



*** User directory Python 2.7.3 installation ***

- Install pythonbrew (follow instructions at: https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew ) 

- then install python 2.7.3:

Only for OSX 10.5 (Lepopard): use homebrew (see: see: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ )
to install 'sqlite3' and 'curl' (and symlink the "curl-config" file from its Cellar to homebrew's bin)

% pythonbrew install 2.7.3

- follow the post instructions, set up your PATH and activate 2.7.3:

% pythonbrew switch 2.7.3

- (you might need to reload your shell for the next line to work)
check that python2.7 is in the '.pythonbrew' directory using: 

% which python2.7

- install easy_install to make your life easier:

% wget -q http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

OSX note: if you do not have wget, maybe it is time to install
'homebrew' ( see: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ ) or use curl:
 % curl -kLO http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

- add ez_setup to your python 2.7 installation:

% python2.7 ez_setup.py

- install required components:

% easy_install-2.7 zope2

% easy_install-2.7 pycrypto

% easy_install-2.7 twisted

% easy_install-2.7 pyasn1

% easy_install-2.7 pyxml

% easy_install-2.7 pycurl

- at this point, you should have the required components needed to use 'aaagent'



*** Linux repository for system wide installation of Python ***

On Ubuntu, you can add a repository for old Python versions:

% sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
% sudo apt-get update
% sudo apt-get install python2.7

After this installation, please check the previous installation entry
for easy_install module installation.
