Tool: ViDAT
File: README
Date: February 22nd, 2010


This suite of tools is designed to overlay video with boxes, polygons, etc. on 
a frame by frame basis.  The primary specification of the drawed objects is 
specified by an Tracking log file that is described in generated with 
CLEARDTScorer.

The suite has two scripts:
 - vidatLog.pl which generates an annotated video regarding a set of parameters,
   a original video, and a tracking log from CLEARDTScorer.
 - pmontage.pl is an script which creates a mozaic video of a set of input 
   videos.


INSTALLATION
------------

VidAT consist of a set of PERL scripts that can be run in a shell terminal.
Third part software need to be installed:

 FFmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org/>
 Ghostscript <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/>
 ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org> 
    with JPEG v6b support <http://www.ijg.org>


USAGE
-----

Consult the manual pages by running the commands:

   %perl -I<VIDAT_DIRECTORY> <VIDAT_DIRECTORY>/vidatLog.pl --man
   %perl -I<VIDAT_DIRECTORY> <VIDAT_DIRECTORY>/pmontage.pl --man

EXAMPLE
-------

The following command line will generate a video with the snail trails for the 
frames between the frames defined in the tracking log:
$ perl -I. vidatLog.pl -i example/sample.mpeg \
                       -l example/sample.tracking_log \
                       -k auto \
                       -o example/sample.new.mpeg

The following command line will generate frames without the snail trails for the 
frames defined in the tracking log:
$ perl -I. vidatLog.pl -i example/sample.mpeg \
                       -l example/sample.tracking_log \
                       -onlyframes \
                       -o example/sample.frames

To build a montage video from the original and the annotated form:
$ perl -I . pmontage.pl -i example/sample.mpeg \
                        -i example/sample.new.mpeg \
                        -o example/montage.mpeg
