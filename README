This directory contains the Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE)
software package.  It contains a set of evaluation tools for detection
evaluations and for specific NIST-coordinated evaluations listed below.
	
  - 2008 TRECVid Event Detection Evaluation. 
    - TV08Scorer - The main evaluation script. 
    - TV08ViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
      both system output viper files and reference annotation files.
    - TV08MergeHelper - A TRECVid '08 VIPeR-formatted file merging program.  


INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is a 4 step process:

  1. Set the the environment variable 'F4DE_BASE' to be the base directory
     of the F4DE software package.
  2. Test the code by executing 'make check' to make sure all required
     libraries and executables are available on the system and that
     all software checks pass.
  3. Execute the command 'make install' to copy the executables into 
     '$F4DE_BASE/bin', perl modules into '$F4DE_BASE/lib', and XSD/Data files
     into '$F4DE_BASE/lib/data'.
  4. Add '$F4DE_BASE/bin' to your path environment variable.

USAGE
-----

A manual page can be printed by each command by executing the command
with the option '--man'.  For example:

   %  TV08Scorer --man

The manual pages contain command line examples for each tool.  To try
some command lines with data files, go to the testing directories in
'TrecVid08/test/<TOOLNAME>' and try the command lines printed on the
first line of the res*.txt test case files.
