F4DE Version: 2.0 (beta9)


This directory contains the Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE)
software package.  It contains a set of evaluation tools for detection
evaluations and for specific NIST-coordinated evaluations listed below.

  *  CLEAR07 Evaluation. 
      - Domains: Broadcast News, Meeting Room, Surveillance and UAV
      - Measures: Area and Point
    - Detection and Tracking (DT) tools:
      - CLEARDTScorer - The main DT evaluation script.
      - CLEARDTViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
        both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
    - Text Recognition (TR) tools:
      - CLEARTRScorer - The main TR evaluation script.
      - CLEARTRViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
        both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
	
  *  2008 TRECVid Event Detection Evaluation. 
    - TV08Scorer - The main evaluation script. 
    - TV08ViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
      both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
    - TV08MergeHelper - A TRECVid '08 ViPER-formatted file merging program.  
    - TV08_BigXML_ValidatorHelper - A helper program (that relies 
      on TV08ViperValidator and TV08MergeHelper) to perform syntactic
      and semantic validation on ViPER-formatted files containing 
      a large number of event observations.
    - TV08ED-SubmissionChecker - A tool designed to help confirm submission
      archives before transmitting them to NIST. 

  *  2009 TRECVid Event Detection Evaluation. 
    - Same tools as the 2008 TRECVid Event Detection Evaluation (TV08Scorer,
      TV08ViperValidator, TV08MergeHelper, TV08_BigXML_ValidatorHelper)
    - TV09ED-SubmissionChecker - A tool designed to help confirm submission
      archives before transmitting them to NIST. 

  *  AVSS09 Evaluation.
    - AVSS09Scorer - The main evaluation script. 
    - AVSS09ViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
      both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
    - AVSS09-SubmissionChecker - A tool designed to help confirm submission
      archives before transmitting them to NIST. 


INSTALLATION
------------

F4DE consists of a set of Perl scripts that can be run under a shell terminal.
It has been confirmed to work under Linux, OS X and Cygwin.
The only pre-requisites of the tool are:
- a recent version of gnuplot (4.2 preferred, with png support)
  to plot DETCurves for TV08Scorer.
- a recent version of xmllint (part of libxml2) to validate XML files
  against their corresponding schema files.
- some Perl modules (available on CPAN [http://www.cpan.org/]). Availibility
  of those will be tested during step 1 ('make check') of the installation
  process.
- the 'rsync' tool available in your PATH (used in the installation process)

Installation is a 4 step process:

  1. At minimum, run 'make mincheck' to make sure all required libraries
     and executables are available on the system.
      We recommend running 'make check' to run a full check to confirm
     that all software checks pass [*]. Each individual tool can be tested
     independently from the other, type 'make' in the base F4DE directory
     to see the option list.
      Please note that each tool's individual test can take from a few
     seconds to a few minutes to complete. 
      IMPORTANT: The 'F4DE_BASE' environment variable must not be set
     for this step to complete. Checks are designed to be run before and
     independently from any installation and might not work if the 
     'F4DE_BASE' environment variable is set.      
  2. Set the environment variable 'F4DE_BASE' to be the base directory
     of the F4DE software package installation.
  3. Execute the command 'make install' to copy the executables into 
     '$F4DE_BASE/bin', perl modules into '$F4DE_BASE/lib', XSD and other
     data files into '$F4DE_BASE/lib/data', and available man pages
     in '$F4DE_BASE/man'
  4. Add '$F4DE_BASE/bin' to your PATH environment variable and 
     '$F4DE_BASE/man' to your MANPATH environment variable

[*] If one of the Tools tests fails, please follow the bug reports submission 
instructions detailed in the "TEST CASE BUG REPORT" section.
 For information, in each of those tests, the command line that was run by the
test can be found in the corresponding test number ("res*.txt") file as the
first line in the COMMANDLINE section.


CYGWIN PRE-INSTALLATION NOTES
----------------------------

The tools have been confirmed to work under windows when running cygwin.
After downloading the latest "setup.exe" from http://www.cygwin.com/
make sure to add the following when in the "Select Packages":
 - in "Devel", select "make" (required)
 - in "Perl", select "perl" (required)
 - in "Libs", select "libxml2" (required)
 - in "Net", select "rsync" (required) 
 - in "Math", select "gnuplot" (to be able to use TV08Scorer)
 - in "Archive", select "unzip" (to be able to use zip files with
   submission checker tools)


USAGE
-----

A manual page can be printed by each command by executing the command
with the option '--man'.  For example:

   %  TV08Scorer --man

The manual pages contain command line examples for each tool.

To try some command lines with data files, go to the testing directories
relative to the evaluation tool you are trying to test, in 
'CLEAR/test/<TOOLNAME>', 'TrecVid08/test/<TOOLNAME>' or 
'AVSS09/test/<TOOLNAME>' and try the command lines printed on the
first line of the res*.txt test case files.


CONTACT
-------

       Please send bug reports to <nist_f4de@nist.gov>

For the bug report to be useful, please include the command line,
files and text output, including the error message in your email.


TEST CASE BUG REPORT
--------------------

If the error occurred wile doing a 'make check', go in the directory 
associated with the tool that failed ('CLEAR/test/<TOOLNAME>',
'TrecVid08/test/<TOOLNAME>' or 'AVSS09/test/<TOOLNAME>') and type 
'make makecompcheckfiles'. This process will create a file corresponding
to each test number named "res_test*.txt-comp". These file are (like their
.txt equivalent) text files that can be compared to the original 
"res_test*.txt" files.
 When a test fails, please send us the "res_test*.txt-comp" file of the
failed test(s) for us to try to understand what happened, as well as 
information about your system (OS, architecture, ...) that you think
might help us.  Thank you for helping us improve F4DE.
