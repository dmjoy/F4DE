F4DE Version: 2.0 (beta 1)


This directory contains the Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE)
software package.  It contains a set of evaluation tools for detection
evaluations and for specific NIST-coordinated evaluations listed below.

  *  CLEAR07 Evaluation. 
      - Domains: Broadcast News, Meeting Room, Surveillance and UAV
      - Mesures: Area and Point
    - Detection and Tracking (DT) tools:
      - CLEARDTScorer - The main DT evaluation script.
      - CLEARDTViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
        both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
    - Text Recognition (TR) tools:
      - CLEARTRScorer - The main TR evaluation script.
      - CLEARTRViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
        both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
	
  *  2008 TRECVid Event Detection Evaluation. 
    - TV08Scorer - The main evaluation script. 
    - TV08ViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
      both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.
    - TV08MergeHelper - A TRECVid '08 ViPER-formatted file merging program.  
    - TV08_BigXML_ValidatorHelper - An helper program (that relies 
      on TV08ViperValidator and TV08MergeHelper) to perform syntactic
      and semantic validation on ViPER-formatted files containing 
      a large number of event observations.
    - TV08ED-SubmissionChecker - A tool designed to help confirm submission
      archives before transmitting them to NIST. 

  *  AVSS09 Evaluation.
    - AVSS09Scorer - The main evaluation script. 
    - AVSS09ViperValidator - A syntactic and semantic validator for 
      both system output ViPER files and reference annotation files.


INSTALLATION
------------

F4DE consist of a set of Perl scripts that can be run under a shell terminal.
It has been confirmed to work under Linux, OS X and Cygwin.
The only pre-requisites of the tool are:
-  a recent version of gnuplot (4.2 preferred, with png support)
   to plot DETCurves for TV08Scorer.
- a recent version of xmllint (part of libxml2) to validate XML files
  against their corresponding schema files.
- some Perl modules (available on CPAN [http://www.cpan.org/]). Availibility
  of those will be tested during step 1 ('make check') of the installation
  process.
- the 'rsync' tool available in your PATH (used in the installation process)

Installation is a 4 step process:

  1. Test the code by executing 'make check' to make sure all required
     libraries and executables are available on the system and that
     all software checks pass [*]. Please note that the 'F4DE_BASE' 
     environment variable should not be set for this step.
  2. Set the environment variable 'F4DE_BASE' to be the base directory
     of the F4DE software package.
  3. Execute the command 'make install' to copy the executables into 
     '$F4DE_BASE/bin', perl modules into '$F4DE_BASE/lib', and XSD/Data files
     into '$F4DE_BASE/lib/data'.
  4. Add '$F4DE_BASE/bin' to your path environment variable.

[*] If one of the Tools tests fails, please follow the bug reports submission 
instructions detailed in the CONTACT section. The command line 
that we would like you to run for each test can be found in the corresponding
test number "res* .txt" file as its first line in the COMMANDLINE section.


CYGWIN PRE-INSTALLATION NOTES
----------------------------

The tools have been confirmed to work under windows when running cygwin.
After downloading the latest "setup.exe" from http://www.cygwin.com/
make sure to add the following when in the "Select Packages":
 - in "Devel", select "make" (required)
 - in "Perl", select "perl" (required)
 - in "Libs", select "libxml2" (required)
 - in "Math", select "gnuplot" (to be able to use TV08Scorer)
 - in "Archive", select "unzip" (to be able to use zip files with
   TV08ED-SubmissionChecker)


USAGE
-----

A manual page can be printed by each command by executing the command
with the option '--man'.  For example:

   %  TV08Scorer --man

The manual pages contain command line examples for each tool.

To try some command lines with data files, go to the testing directories
relative to the evaluation tool you are trying to test, in 
'CLEAR/test/<TOOLNAME>', 'TrecVid08/test/<TOOLNAME>' or 
'AVSS09/test/<TOOLNAME>' and try the command lines printed on the
first line of the res*.txt test case files.
