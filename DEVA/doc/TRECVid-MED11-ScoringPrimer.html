<h2>Description</h2>
This document provides a high-level overview of how to use the Detection EVAluation (DEVA) tools distributed 
within the NIST Framework for Detection Evaluation (F4DE)
toolkit for the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/med11.cfm">TRECVID
MED11 Evaluation</a>.
The Multimedia Event Detection (MED) evaluation track is part of the
TRECVID Evaluation. The multi-year goal of MED is to assemble core
detection technologies into a system that can quickly and accurately
search a multimedia collection for user-defined events. See the web
site for specific details about the evaluation.
<p>There are three sections in this document: <a href="#executable">Scoring
script synopsis</a>, <a href="#format">CSV File format definition</a>, and <a
 href="#cliuse">Example command lines to score a MED11 submission</a>.
The examples below assume the F4DE package has been
installed and is working properly according to the README.&nbsp; This
includes defining the $F4DE_BASE environment variable and
$F4DE_BASE/bin is in your path
variable. The variable DIST used below is the path to the F4DE
source directory and is not part of the F4DE installation instructions.<br>

<p>  The examples below also assume that you have obtained and have access
to the content the MED11 DRYRUN
files (<a
href="ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/incoming/MED11_Primer/MED11_DRYRUN_Files.tar.bz2">MED11_DRYRUN_Files.tar.bz2</a>),
as well as the MED11 Primer files (<a href="ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/incoming/MED11_Primer/MED11_Primer_Files.tar.bz2">MED11_Primer_Files.tar.bz2</a>).

<h2>Scoring Script Synopsis</h2>
</a>

<b>DEVA_cli</b> is the <i>Detection EVAluation command line
interface</i>.  NIST will use DEVA_cli to measure the performance of MED systems.  
The software uses <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> to manage
the data tables and then uses SQLite compatible queries to select
data to score. The input to the software is a set of <i>Comma Separated Value</i> (CSV) tables as defined in Section 3. 

<p> The MED evaluation tests a system's ability to detect if an event (as defined by an event kit) occurs within a video of the test collection.  An MED system computes the probability that the event occured for each event kit/test video combination, a decision threshold for the event optimizing the primary metric, and the total processing time for the detection of an event.  For the DEVA tools, each time a system computes an event/test video probability, it is called a <i>trial</i>.  Each trial is identified by a unique <b>TrialID</b>.  TrialIDs are grouped into a statistical sample block referred to as a which are identified by a <i>BlockID</i>.  For MED11, the EventIDs are used as BlockIDs. 

<p>  DEVA_cli accepts a variety of input combinations, however, to perform the MED11 scoring with the standard setup, LDC will provide a set of data files and MED11 systems will generate a set of files.

<UL>
<LI> <b>Provided Data Files</b>: NIST/LDC will provide the following
  database files for use in scoring (all those files will be available
  for DRYRUN but not for MED11TEST)

<UL>
<LI> <bold> TrialIndex file: </bold> 
the TrialID list (and its decomposition in its core components) - <i>TrialID</i>, <i>ClipID</i>, <i>EventID</i>
</li>

<LI> <bold> Reference File: </bold> The <b>reference</b> CSV file
defines which TrialIDs are target trials (the video contains an
instance of the event) and which TrialIDs are non-target trials (the
video does not contain an instance of the event).  The file must
contain two columns: <i>TrialID</i> and <i>Targ</i>, where <i>TrialID</i> must be a primary key and <i>Targ</i>
values must be either <i>y</i> a target or <i>n</i> otherwise. 
</li>

<LI> <bold> Event Database file: </bold> 
the event description metadata file.  Currently the file maps the
<i>EventID</i> to <i>EventName</i>.
<ul>
  <li><i>EventID</i>: is the events ID
  <li><i>EventName</i>: is the textual name of the event
</ul>
</li>

<LI> <bold> Judgement Meta Data file: </bold> 
the ClipID's Event Metadata file (copied from the source database); Judgments for background clips are intentionally incomplete.   

For each unique ClipID,
<ul>
  <li><i>EventID</i>: is the ID one of the MED-11 events or NULL indicating no event judgment was made.
  <li><i>INSTANCE_TYPE</i>: positive denotes that this clip is a positive (true) instance of the specified event
  <li><i>SYNOPSIS</i>: brief summary of the clip content  
  <li><i>GENRE</i>: data scout judgment about the clip's genre
  <li><i>TOPIC</i>: general topic category for this clip
  <li><i>SCENE</i>: optional freeform description by data scout of the scene/setting for the clip
  <LI><I>OBJECTS</I>: optional freeform description by the data scout of the objects/people shown in the clip
  <LI><i>ACTIVITIES</i>: optional freeform description by the data scout of the activities shown in the clip
  <li><i>INSTANCE_VARIETY</i>: subjective judgment by data scout about whether this clip is more unusual than other instances of this event      
  <li><i>INSTANCE_COMPLEXITY</i>: subjective judgment by data scout about whether this clip is more difficult/complex than other instances of this event
  <li><i>AUDIO_EVIDENCE</i>: does this clip contain audio evidence supporting the event
  <li><i>TEXT_EVIDENCE</i>: does this clip contain text evidence supporting the event
  <li><i>NON_ENG_SPEECH</i>: does this clip contain non-English speech
  <li><i>NON_ENG_TEXT</i>: does this clip contain non-English text
  <li><i>NARRATIVE_AUDIO</i>: does the clip include someone explaining or describing (some or all of) the event step-by-step as they perform it. Empty when the Event is NULL. May be empty for some non-NULL events.
  <li><i>NARRATIVE_TEXT</i>: does the clip include text explaining or describing (some or all of) the event step-by-step as it is performed. Empty when the Event is NULL. May be empty for some non-NULL events.
  <li><i>INSTANCE_COMMENT</i>: optional comment providing additional
  information about why the clip was labeled as a negative
  instance.
</ul>
  
</li>
<LI> <bold> Clip Meta Data file: </bold> 
general clip metadata including a unique ClipID, associated <i>MEDIA_FILE</i>, <i>CODEC</i>, <i>MD5SUM</i> and <i>DURATION</i>
where:
<ul>
<li><i>ClipID</i>: unique numerical ID for this video/metadata entry (extracted from the RANDOM_MEDIA_FILE information)
<li><i>MEDIA_FILE</i>: randomized, non-chronological filename for the media file corresponding to this entry.
<li><i>MD5SUM</i>: MD5 checksum for the media file corresponding to this entry
<li><i>DURATION</i>: duration in seconds for the media file corresponding to this entry.
</ul>
</li>


</UL>

<li> <b> System Generated Output Files: </b> Per the evaluation plan, MED11 system will generate two CSV formatted files.  
<ul>
  <li> The <b>detection</b> CSV file contains the confidence score for each TrialID in the test.  The file must contain two columns with column headings:
  <i>TrialID</i> and <i>Score</i>, where <i>TrialID</i> must be a
  primary key and <i>Score</i> must be a value contained within 0.0
  and 1.0</li>
  <li> The <b>threshold</b> CSV file contains information about the processed event the Detection Threshold (as defined in Section 2.2.2 of the evaluation plan). 
It must contain three columns:
  <i>EventID</i>, <i>DetectionThreshold</i> and <i>DetectionTPT</i>,
  where <i>EventID</i> must be a primary key and <i>DetectionThreshold</i> must be a value contained within 0.0
  and 1.0, while <i>DetectionTPT</i> is an unbounded value (see EvalPlan for details).</li>
</ul>


</LI>
</UL>


<a name="format">
<h2>CSV File Format Definition</h2>
</a>DEVA_cli uses <i>Comma Separated Values</i> (CSV)
files to
generate SQL tables that will be used by the scoring tool. CSV files
are ASCII text files where each line contains comma separate, double quote enclosed values.   The DEVA tools require the first row of a CSV file to contain the
column's header.  The following is a valid CSV file that contains three columns and two rows of data:
</p>
<dir>
<code>
"ID","FirstName","LastName"<br>
"1","John","Doe"</br>
"2","Mary","Smith"
</code>
</dir>


<br>
<a name="cliuse">
<h2>Example command lines to score a MED11 submission</h2>
</a>
<p><i>For further information about the DEVA_cli tool (available as
part of the F4DE), please refer to its manual:
<code>DEVA_cli --man</code></i></p>
For the optional metadata database files, the CSV file names will be
used as SQL table name. The program leaves the content of the database
to be free-form.

Although, one of the metadata table must be named <b>TrialIndex</b>
and must contain a <i>TrialID</i> primary key column that match the value present in the <b>reference</b> or <b>system</b>
CSV, as well as a <i>EventID</i> and <i>ClipID</i>.


The following is an example of how to score one system run using the default scoring setup using files formatted for submission to NIST.  

<p>The MED11 Primer files (<a href="ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/incoming/MED11_Primer/MED11_Primer_Files.tar.bz2">MED11_Primer_Files.tar.bz2</a>) contain system-generated output files for a random system processing the Dry Run data set.  The files are <code>testTEAM_MED11_DEVT_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.detection.csv</code>
and <code>testTEAM_MED11_DEVT_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.threshold.csv</code>.  The file names follow the prescribed structure of the EXP-ID described in Appendix B of the evaluation plan where:

<UL> <LI> The <i>TEAM</i> named "testTEAM",
  <LI> The processed <i>DATA</i> set is "DRYRUN", 
  <LI> The style of event agent generation <i> EAG</i> is automatice EAG "AutoEAG",
  <LI> The type of <i>MEDTYPE</i> of system is "MEDFull",
  <LI> The <i>SYSID</i> is "RandomSys",
  <LI> The <i>VERSION</i> number is "1". 
  </UL>
  
In Using the MED11 DRYRUN
files (<a href="ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/incoming/MED11_DRYRUN_Files.tar.bz2">MED11_DRYRUN_Files.tar.bz2</a>), the following command will score the run:

</doc>
<pre>
% mkdir testTEAM-Results1
% DEVA_cli\
--profile MED11\
--outdir testTEAM-Results1 \
--refcsv DRYRUN_Ref.csv \
--syscsv testTEAM_MED11_DRYRUN_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.detection.csv:detection \
--syscsv testTEAM_MED11_DRYRUN_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.threshold.csv:threshold \
DRYRUN_ClipMD.csv:ClipMD \
DRYRUN_JudgementMD.csv:JudgementMD \
DRYRUN_TrialIndex.csv:TrialIndex \
DRYRUN_EventDB.csv:EventDB
</pre>
where:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The "testTEAM-Results1" directory (which must exist before
running this command) will contain all the output generated by the script.</li>
  <li>The <code>--profile MED11</code> argument provides preconfigured command line options (e.g., the metric, trial selection, join, ...) for the MED11 evaluation</li>
  <li>The CSV filenames use the <code>:</code> notation (example: <code>DRYRUN_ClipMD.csv:ClipMD</code>) to provide simple table names for use in the SQL statements.  </li>
</ul>

The script will run through the four steps of the DEVA_cli scorer and
place in the "<i>testTEAM_Results1</i>" directory.
Note that the correct detection of a <i>n</i> <i>Targ</i> <b>Reference</b> is not counted.

There are many files generated by the script.  The most notable are:

<UL> 

<LI> <i>testTEAM-Results1/scoreDB.scores.txt</i>, a text version of the scoring report which
includes five sections for each EventID.   
<ul>
  <li> The "Inputs" section:
  <UL>
    <li> <code>#Targ</code> the number of target TrialIDs. </li>
    <li> <code>#NTarg</code> the number of non-target TrialIDs. </li>
    <li> <code>#Sys</code> the number of system TrialIDs with responses.  For MED11 this should equal #Targ + #NTarg. </li>
  </UL>
  <li> The "Actual Decision Cost Analysis" section shows the performance of the system using the Actual Decision Threshold supplied for the system </li>
  <UL>
    <li> <code>#CorDet</code> the number correct target detections</li>
    <li> <code>#Cor!Det</code> the number of non-target TrialIDs</li>
    <li> <code>#FA</code> the number of non-positive clips &gt; the Detection Threshold</li>
    <li> <code>#Miss</code> the number of positive clips &lt;= the Detection Threshold</li>
    <li> <code>#PFA</code> (Event, Decision Threshold) = #FA (Event,
    Decision Threshold) / (#TotalClips - #Targets (Event))</li>
    <li> <code>#PMiss</code> (Event, Decision Threshold) = #MD (Event,
    Decision Threshold) / #Targets (Event)</li>
    <li> <code>#NormCost</code>, the Normalized Detection Cost function is a weighted linear combination missed detection and false alarm probabilities.</li>
    <li> <code>#Dec. Thresh</code>, the Decision Threshold for a given Event.</li>
  </UL>
  <li> The "Minimum NormCost Analysis" section shows an analysis of
  the DET curve to find threshold that acheives the minimum NDC
  point. All of the following use a definition similar to the above
  one:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>#PFA</code>
    <li> <code>#PMiss</code>
    <li> <code>#NormCost</code>
    <li> <code>#Dec. Thresh</code>
  </UL>
  <li> "DET Curve" shows the PNG filename of the DET curve that EventID. </li>
  <li> Threshold Curve shows the PNG filename that displays PMiss, PFA, and NDC as a function of Decision score for that EventID. </li>

</ul>

<LI> <i>testTEAM-Results1/scoreDB.det.png</i>, a single PNG file containing the DET line traces for all of the scored EventIDs. </LI>   

<LI> <i>testTEAM-Results1/scoreDB.det.*.srl.gz</i>, serialized versions of each EventIDs DET curve.  These files can be used as input to  <code> DETUtil</code> to produce selective DET Curve plots.  For example to plot just E002 and E003, use following the command.  The produced png file will be 'focusSet.png'.

<pre>
% DETUtil -T "Events E002 and E003" -o focusSet.png testTEAM-Results1/*E00[23]*srl.gz
</pre>

</ul>

<br>
<a name="clifilter">
<h3>Performing Selective TrialID Scoring</h3>
</a>

DEVA_cli accepts as an option </code>--FilterCMDfile SQLFile</code>
which filters the TrialIDs included in the scoring run.

For sites only participating in some of the events, the default SQL filter will insure that only the <i>TrialID</i>s
listed in the system CSV will be used. <i>A submission checker will
be released soon to other among things verifies that all <span style="font-style: italic;">TrialIDs </span> for an event are present
in the system file.

The default filter's definition (located in the
<code>DEVAcli_filter-MED11.sql</code> file), is as follow:
<pre>
INSERT OR ABORT INTO ResultsTable ( TrialID, BlockID )
  SELECT system.TrialID,TrialIndex.EventID FROM TrialIndex INNER JOIN system
  WHERE system.TrialID==TrialIndex.TrialID;
</pre>


An <b>SQL filter</b>, such as <code>DEVAcli_filter-MED11_primer.sql</code> found in the primer tar file, restricts the selection of TrialIDs to only those whose ClipIDs duration is less than 30 seconds. The SQL command is:

<pre>
INSERT OR ABORT INTO ResultsTable ( TrialID, BlockID )
  SELECT system.TrialID,TrialIndex.EventID FROM TrialIndex INNER JOIN system,ClipMD
  WHERE system.TrialID==TrialIndex.TrialID AND TrialIndex.ClipID==ClipMD.ClipID AND ClipMD.DURATION<30;
</pre>

Two use the filter, execute the following commands: 

<pre>
% mkdir testTEAM-Results2
% DEVA_cli\
--profile MED11\
--outdir testTEAM-Results2 \
--refcsv DRYRUN_Ref.csv \
--syscsv testTEAM_MED11_DRYRUN_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.detection.csv:detection \
--syscsv testTEAM_MED11_DRYRUN_AutoEAG_MEDFull_RandomSys_1.threshold.csv:threshold \
DRYRUN_ClipMD.csv:ClipMD \
DRYRUN_JudgementMD.csv:JudgementMD \
DRYRUN_TrialIndex.csv:TrialIndex \
DRYRUN_EventDB.csv:EventDB \
--FilterCMDfile DEVAcli_filter-MED11_primer.sql
</pre>
