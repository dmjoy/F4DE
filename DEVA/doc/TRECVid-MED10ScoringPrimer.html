<h2>Description: </h2>
This document provides a high-level overview of how to use the F4DE
tools for the TRECVid MED Evaluations.&nbsp;
<br>
There are five sections in this document:<a
href="#nomenclature">nomenclature</a>, <a href="#executable">executable
script synopsis</a>, <a href="#format">file format</a>, <a
href="#cliuse">using the tool</a>, and <a href="#scoring">scoring a submission</a>.&nbsp;
The examples below assume the F4DE package has been
installed and is working properly according to the README including
$F4DE_BASE is defined and $F4DE_BASE/bin is in your path
variable.&nbsp;
The variable DIST used below is the path to the F4DE
source directory and is not part of the F4DE installation instructions.<br>

<a name="nomenclature"><h2>Nomenclature:</h2></a>
The Multimedia Event Detection (MED) evaluation track is part of the TRECVID Evaluation. The multi-year goal of MED is to assemble core detection technologies into a system that can quickly and accurately search a multimedia collection for user-defined events. An event for MED 2010 is &quot;an activity-centered happening that involves people engaged in process-driven actions with other people and/or objects at a specific place and time&quot;.<br>
A user searching for events in multimedia material may be interested in a wide variety of potential events. Since it is an intractable task to build special purpose detectors for each event a priori, a technology is needed that can take as input a definition of the event that a human can use to search a collection of multimedia clips.<br>
The MED task is: given an Event Kit, find all clips that contain the event in a video collection.<br>
The MED task is a "multimedia" task in that systems will be expected to detect evidence of the event using either or both the audio and video streams (but not human-created textual metadata) of the clips.<br>


<a name="executable"><h2>Executable Script Synopsys:</h2></a>
<b>DEVA_cli</b> is the <i>Detection EVAluation command line
interface</i> software that is used for scoring the MED
evaluation.<br>
The software is designed to use SQL tables to do queries.<br>
The software reads one reference <i>Comma Separated Values</i> (CSV)
file, one system CSV file and optionaly mulitple metadata CSV files,
and create multiple databases (one for reference, one for system and
one for all metadata tables), and will apply a SQL <i>SELECT</i> on
these databases.<br>


<a name="format"><h2>File Formats:</h2></a>
The TRECVid MED tools use <i>Comma Separated Values</i> (CSV) files to
generate SQL tables that will be used by the scoring tool.<br>

For the metadata, the CSV file names will be used as SQL table name, and must have as a first row the column headers that will be used as the SQL table column name.
To avoid issues in processing the data, it is recommended that each
column content be quoted and comma separated. For example, a table
whose SQL table name is expected to be &quot;Employee&quot; will be
represented as the &quot;Employee.csv&quot; file and contain a first
row: <pre>"ID","FirstName","LastName"</pre> and an example a one
such  entry could be: <pre>"1","John","Doe"</pre>
<br>
The program leave the content of the database free for most metadata content. One of the table that is part of that database should contain a <i>TrialID</i> column that match the one present in the <b>reference</b> or <b>system</b> CSV.
<br>
The <b>reference</b> CSV file must contain two columns: <i>TrialID</i> and <i>Targ</i>, where <i>TrialID</i> must be a primary key and <i>Targ</i> values must be a either <i>y</i> or <i>n</i>.
<br>
The <b>system</b> CSV file must contain three columns: <i>TrialID</i>, <i>Score</i> and <i>Decision</i>, where <i>TrialID</i> must be a primary key, <i>Score</i> a numerical value and <i>Targ</i> values must be a either <i>y</i> or <i>n</i>.

<a name="cliuse"><h2>Using the DEVA_cli tool:</h2></a>
For further information about the DEVA_cli tool (available as part of
the F4DE), please refer to its manual:
<pre>DEVA_cli --man</pre>

<a name="scoring"><h2>Scoring a MED submission</h2></a>

The following is an example of scoring a DEV submission, using some of
the CSV files that are provided in the I<doc> directory of the DEV
set and a site submission CSV file named &quot;SITE_1.csv&quot;,
which follows the rules set for a system CSV file and contains all the <i>TrialID</i> present in the <i>DEV_TrialIndex.csv</i> file.<br>
<br>
<pre>% DEVA_cli --outdir SITE_Results --refcsv
DEV_Ref.csv --syscsv SITE_1.csv --FilterCMDfile med10_filter.cmd
--UsedMetricParameters 'CostMiss=1' --UsedMetricParameters 'Ptarg=0.1'
--UsedMetricParameters 'CostFA=1' DEV_ClipMD.csv DEV_JudgementMD.csv
DEV_TrialIndex.csv</pre>
<br>
where the SQL filter (&quot;med10_filter.cmd&quot;) is:
<pre>SELECT TrialID,Event FROM DEV_TrialIndex;</pre>

This will run through the four step process done by DEVA_cli, and
under the <i>SITE_Results</i> will be present afile titled
<i>scoreDB_DET.scores.txt</i> that will contain a human readable
detail:
<ul>
  <li> the number of <i>y</i> <i>Targ</i> <b>Reference</b> entries
  (<code>#Ref</code>)
  <li> the number of <b>System</b> entries (<code>#Sys</code>)
  <li> the number of correct detections of <i>y</i> <i>Targ</i>
  <b>Reference</b> by the <b>System</b> (<code>#CorDet</code>)
  <li> the number of false alarms: <i>y</i> <b>System</b>
  <i>Decision</i> for a <i>n</i> <i>Targ</i> <b>Reference</b>
  (<code>$FA</code>)
  <li> the number of missed detections of a  <i>y</i> <i>Targ</i>
  <b>Reference</b> by the <b>System</b> (<code>#Miss</code>)
</ul>
Note that the correct detection of a <i>n</i> <i>Targ</i>
<b>Reference</b> is not counted.
