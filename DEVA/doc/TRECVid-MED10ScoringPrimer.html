<h2>Description: </h2>
This document provides a high-level overview of how to use the F4DE
tools for the TRECVid MED Evaluations.&nbsp;
This document refers to examples in the F4DE
distribution to get a researcher quickly up to speed using the toolkit
to evaluate the performance of their systems.<br>
<br>
There are five sections in this document: nomenclature, file format
definitions,
executable script synopses, annotation file validation, and scoring
scripts.&nbsp;
The examples below assume the F4DE package has been
installed and is working properly according to the README including
$F4DE_BASE is defined and $F4DE_BASE/bin is in your path
variable.&nbsp;
The variable DIST used below is the path to the F4DE
source directory and is not part of the F4DE installation instructions.<br>
<h2>Nomenclature:</h2>
The Multimedia Event Detection (MED) evaluation track is part of the TRECVID Evaluation. The multi-year goal of MED is to assemble core detection technologies into a system that can quickly and accurately search a multimedia collection for user-defined events. An event for MED 2010 is &quote;an activity-centered happening that involves people engaged in process-driven actions with other people and/or objects at a specific place and time&quote;.<br>
A user searching for events in multimedia material may be interested in a wide variety of potential events. Since it is an intractable task to build special purpose detectors for each event a priori, a technology is needed that can take as input a definition of the event that a human can use to search a collection of multimedia clips.<br>
The MED task is: given an Event Kit, find all clips that contain the event in a video collection.<br>
The MED task is a "multimedia" task in that systems will be expected to detect evidence of the event using either or both the audio and video streams (but not human-created textual metadata) of the clips.<br>
<h2>File Formats:</h2>
The TRECVid MED tools use <i>Comma Separated Values</i> (CSV) files to
generate SQL tables that will be used by the scoring tool.<br>
<h2>Executable Script Synopses:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>DEVA_cli - the Detection EVAluation command line interface, the
  software that will be used for scoring the MED evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scoring a DEV submission</h2>
A site submission (with a CSV file named &quote;SITE_1.csv&quote;) should contain all the <i>TrialID</i> present in the <i>DEV_TrialIndex.csv</i> file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % DEVA_cli --outdir SITE_Results --refcsv
DEV_Ref.csv --syscsv SITE_1.csv --FilterCMDfile med10_filter.cmd
--UsedMetricParameters 'CostMiss=1' --UsedMetricParameters 'Ptarg=0.1'
--UsedMetricParameters 'CostFA=1' DEV_ClipMD.csv DEV_JudgementMD.csv
DEV_TrialIndex.csv<br>
<br>
where the SQL filter (&quote;med10_filter.cmd&quote;) is:
<br>
SELECT TrialID,Event FROM DEV_TrialIndex;
<br>
For further information about the TRECVid MED and its operation, including details about using it, please refer to the DEVA_cli manual available as part of the F4DE tools (DEVA_cli --man).
