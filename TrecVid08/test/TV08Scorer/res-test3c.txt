***** STEP 1: Loading files in Memory
(SYS) ../common/test2-1md_1fa-sys.xml: Loaded
(SYS) ../common/test3-sys.xml: Loaded
(REF) ../common/test2-gtf.xml: Loaded
(REF) ../common/test3-gtf.xml: Loaded

** SUMMARY: All files loaded

***** STEP 3: Generating EventLists (only adding observations matching loaded ECF)
* SYS EventList: 1 Observation(s) added (10 rejected) [Seen 11 Observations inside 2 file(s)]
* REF EventList: 1 Observation(s) added (9 rejected) [Seen 10 Observations inside 2 file(s)]

** SUMMARY: All EventLists generated
** Common referred to files (2): 20061212.mpg 20050519-1503-Excerpt.mpg
** Only in SYS (0): 
** Only in REF (0): 

[Warning] FYI (comparing ECF to common list): the following files are not listed in the ECF, and therefore will not be scored against: 20061212.mpg
[ERROR] Can not perform soring (comparing ECF to common list): the following files are present in the ECF but not in the common list: 20050519-1503-Excerpt-FAKE.mpg
