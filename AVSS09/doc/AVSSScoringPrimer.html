<h2>Description: </h2>
This document provides a high-level overview of how to use the F4DE
tools for the AVSS09 Multiple Camera Single Person Tracking (MCSPT)
Evaluations.&nbsp; This document refers to examples in the F4DE
distribution to get a researcher quickly up to speed using the toolkit
to evaluate the performance of their systems.<br>
<br>
There are five sections in this document: nomenclature, file format
definitions,
executable script synopses, annotation file validation, and scoring
scripts.&nbsp; The examples below assume the F4DE package has been
installed and is working properly according to the README including
$F4DE_BASE is defined and $F4DE_BASE/bin is in your path
variable.&nbsp; The variable DIST used below is the path to the F4DE
source directory and is not part of the F4DE installation instructions.<br>
<h2>Nomenclature:</h2>
The MCSPT evaluation is designed to evaluate systems that can track a
single, specific person within an ensemble of concurrently recorder
videos.&nbsp; We call the person to track the 'target'.<br>
<br>
We refer to collection of the following as a 'track instance' which
defines the inputs to the system for a single tested track:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start and end frame:</span> this
is the duration of the test sequence for the&nbsp; (across all cameras
for the system to process the video data)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target Tracking Frames (TTF): </span>video
frames containing the bounding box annotations for the subject.&nbsp;
Systems
will use the TTFs to build a model of the target for later tracking.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Primary camera:</span> the
camera view containing the TTFs.&nbsp; The system is expected to track
the target within the primary camera view beginning after the last TTF
for the duration specified by the start/end frame<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondary cameras: </span>the
set of cameras (exclusive of the primary camera) that the system must
track the target in. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>File Formats:</h2>
The AVSS tools use CLEAR-specialized, XML ViPER files as inputs to the
scripts.&nbsp; The CLEAR-specialized ViPER file format is structurally
defined by a set of XSD files located in the '<a href="../../lib/data">$F4DE_BASE/lib/data</a>'
directory.&nbsp; The main XSD file is <a
 href="../../lib/data/CLEAR.xsd">CLEAR.xsd</a> which includes <a
 href="../../lib/data/CLEAR-viper.xsd">CLEAR-viper.xsd</a> and <a
 href="../../lib/data/CLEAR-viperdata.xsd">CLEAR-viperdata.xsd</a>. <br>
<h2>Executable Script Synopses:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AVSS09ViperValidator - a syntactic and semantic validator for
ViPER-formatted AVSS files.</li>
  <li>AVSS09Scorer - a scoring script designed specifically for the
AVSS MCSPT evaluation. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>File Validation with AVSS09ViperValidator:</h2>
In order to ensure systems generate correctly formatted ViPER files for
the MCSPT, the scoring tools include a validator to both syntactically
(properly structure XML files) and semantically (e.g., coherent frame
spans and bounding boxes within the frame spans, etc).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To check a system file, execute the command:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % AVSS09ViPERValidator
$DIST/AVSS09/test/common/test_file1.ss.xml<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To check a ground truth file,
execute the command:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % AVSS09ViPERValidator --gtf
$DIST/AVSS09/test/common/test_file1.clear.xml<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<h2>Scoring a MCSPT system with AVSS09Scorer:</h2>
AVSS09Scorer is a wrapper script to score the output of an MCSPT
system.&nbsp; This initial version of the script does not implement the
full evaluation formalism to score a series of track instances,
ignoring un-scored frames, and limiting the evaluated span of
frames.&nbsp;
Instead, this version is designed to score the output for a single
track instance.&nbsp; (Note: Future versions of the evaluation script
will incorporate the use of an Experiment Control File (ECF) to define
the track instances and the ids output by the system will be specified
a priori.)<br>
<br>
To run the scoring script in a single test file, execute the command:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">% AVSS09Scorer --writedir /tmp \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --gtf $DIST/AVSS09/test/common/test_file*.clear.xml \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $DIST/AVSS09/test/common/test_file*.empty.xml<br>
</div>
&nbsp;<br>
To run the scoring script for a single track instance using the
released training data set for the MCSPT evaluation (See the AVSS MCSPT
web site for details), execute the
following.&nbsp; (The $MCSPT must be set to be the top level of the
data distribution for your system.)<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">% setenv MCSPT /local/ILIDS_MCTTR_Master<br>
% AVSS09Scorer --writedir /tmp \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$MCSPT/http/xml/MCT_TR_01/MCTTR01a/MCTTR010[12345]a.ss.xml \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --gtf&nbsp;
$MCSPT/http/xml/MCT_TR_01/MCTTR01a/MCTTR010[12345]a.clear.xml
</div>
<br>
This hypothetical example scores five if the starter system files&nbsp;
(that contain the 5 TTFs for the camera view if they exist) and scores
them against the CLEAR formated reference files.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
version of the scoring script does not differentiate the primary
cameras from the secondary cameras so all camera views have correct
detections.&nbsp; To score against a set of empty system output files,
execute the following command.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">% setenv MCSPT /local/ILIDS_MCTTR_Master<br>
% AVSS09Scorer --writedir /tmp \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$MCSPT/http/xml/MCT_TR_01/MCTTR01a/MCTTR010[12345]a.empty.xml \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --gtf&nbsp;
$MCSPT/http/xml/MCT_TR_01/MCTTR01a/MCTTR010[12345]a.clear.xml
